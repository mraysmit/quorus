## Module Structure Strategy

### Phase 1 Approach: Single Module with Strategic Packaging

**Key Principles:**
- **Cohesion over Fragmentation**: Group related functionality together
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each package has well-defined responsibility
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduce coupling between packages
- **Future-Proof**: Structure accommodates the 5-phase roadmap
- **Testability**: Easy to unit test and integration test

**Single Module Structure:**
```
quorus/
├── src/main/java/dev/mars/quorus/
│   ├── core/           # Core domain models and interfaces
│   ├── transfer/       # Transfer engine implementation
│   ├── protocol/       # Transfer protocol implementations
│   ├── storage/        # File storage and persistence
│   ├── monitoring/     # Health checks and metrics
│   └── config/         # Configuration management
```

### Future Modularization (Phase 2+)

When clustering features are introduced (Phase 2), extract to multi-module structure:
```
quorus/
├── quorus-core/        # Core domain models
├── quorus-transfer/    # Transfer engine + protocols
├── quorus-cluster/     # Clustering functionality (Phase 2)
├── quorus-security/    # Security features (Phase 3)
└── quorus-analytics/   # AI/ML features (Phase 5)
```

**Migration Strategy:**
- Phase 1: Single module with clear package boundaries
- Phase 2: Extract core and transfer modules when adding clustering
- Phase 3+: Extract additional modules as features grow

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Transfer (Weeks 1-8)

### Milestone 1.1: Basic Transfer Engine (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal:** Single-node file transfer with basic protocols

**Deliverables:**
- Simple HTTP/HTTPS file transfer

- Transfer progress tracking
- Simple retry mechanism

**Success Criteria:**
- Transfer files up to 1GB successfully
- 99% transfer success rate in controlled environment
- Basic progress reporting (bytes transferred, ETA)

**Module Structure Decision:**
For Phase 1, we use a **single-module approach** with well-organized packages to prepare for future modularization:

**Rationale:**
- Milestone 1.1 scope doesn't justify multi-module complexity
- Faster development and easier refactoring
- Package structure prepares for future module extraction
- Simpler testing and integration

**Implementation Tasks:**
```java
// Package structure for single module
src/main/java/dev/mars/quorus/
├── core/                    # Core domain models and interfaces
│   ├── TransferJob.java
│   ├── TransferStatus.java
│   ├── TransferRequest.java
│   ├── TransferResult.java

│   ├── TransferEngine.java (interface)
│   ├── SimpleTransferEngine.java
│   ├── ProgressTracker.java
│   └── TransferContext.java
├── protocol/                # Transfer protocol implementations
│   ├── TransferProtocol.java (interface)
│   ├── HttpTransferProtocol.java
