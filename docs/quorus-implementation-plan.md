## Module Structure Strategy

### Phase 1 Approach: Single Module with Strategic Packaging

**Key Principles:**
- **Cohesion over Fragmentation**: Group related functionality together
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each package has well-defined responsibility
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduce coupling between packages
- **Future-Proof**: Structure accommodates the 5-phase roadmap
- **Testability**: Easy to unit test and integration test

**Single Module Structure:**
```
quorus/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/main/java/dev/mars/quorus/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/           # Core domain models and interfaces
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ transfer/       # Transfer engine implementation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ protocol/       # Transfer protocol implementations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ storage/        # File storage and persistence
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ monitoring/     # Health checks and metrics
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config/         # Configuration management
```

### Future Modularization (Phase 2+)

When clustering features are introduced (Phase 2), extract to multi-module structure:
```
quorus/
â”œâ”€â”€ quorus-core/        # Core domain models
â”œâ”€â”€ quorus-transfer/    # Transfer engine + protocols
â”œâ”€â”€ quorus-cluster/     # Clustering functionality (Phase 2)
â”œâ”€â”€ quorus-security/    # Security features (Phase 3)
â””â”€â”€ quorus-analytics/   # AI/ML features (Phase 5)
```

**Migration Strategy:**
- Phase 1: Single module with clear package boundaries
- Phase 2: Extract core and transfer modules when adding clustering
- Phase 3+: Extract additional modules as features grow

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Transfer (Weeks 1-8)

### Milestone 1.1: Basic Transfer Engine (Weeks 1-2)

**Module Structure Decision:**
For Phase 1, we use a **single-module approach** with well-organized packages to prepare for future modularization:

**Rationale:**
- Milestone 1.1 scope doesn't justify multi-module complexity
- Faster development and easier refactoring
- Package structure prepares for future module extraction
- Simpler testing and integration

**Implementation Tasks:**
