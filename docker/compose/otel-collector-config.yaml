# OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration for Quorus Observability Stack
# Routes traces to Tempo, metrics to Prometheus, logs to Loki
#
# Receives:
#   - OTLP gRPC on 0.0.0.0:4317
#   - OTLP HTTP on 0.0.0.0:4318
#
# Exports:
#   - Traces  -> Tempo (OTLP gRPC)
#   - Metrics -> Prometheus (remote write) - OTLP metrics only
#   - Logs    -> Loki (HTTP)
#
# NOTE: Prometheus metrics scraping is done directly by Prometheus, NOT via OTel Collector
#       to avoid double-counting. OTel Collector only handles OTLP telemetry.
